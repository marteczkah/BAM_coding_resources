# HOMEWORK
# Complete 3 out of 5 (or more if you want :)

# Exercise 1
# Write a function that checks if ANY number in a list is even. Return true if yes, else return FALSE.

# Exercise 2
# Write a function that returns a list of even numbers in a list. 
# Example INPUT: [2, 4,5, 7, 8, 9, 10] OUTPUT: [2,3,8,10]

# Exercise 3
# Write a function that reads a list and returns a list without repetition in values.
# Example INPUT: [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 7, 8, 8] OUTPUT: [2,3,4,5,7,8]

# Exercise 4
# Write a function that reads an integer and returns a reverse of the integer.
# Example INPUT: 123 OUTPUT: 321
# Example INPUT: -123 OUTPUT: -321

# Exercise 5
# Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a merged
# list of all the elements in sorted order. You may modify the passed in lists.
# Ideally, the solution should work in "linear" time, making a single
# pass of both lists. (meaning you can't use nested for loops)
